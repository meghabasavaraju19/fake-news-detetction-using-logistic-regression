fake news detetction using logistic regression
Fake news is false or misleading information presented as news. Fake news often has the aim of
damaging the reputation of a person or entity, or making money through advertising revenue.

The dataset used in this article is taken from Kaggle that is publically available as the Fake and real news dataset. 
This data set has two CSV files containing true and fake news. Each having Title, text, subject and date attributes.
There are 21417 true news data and 23481 fake news data given in the true and fake CSV files respectively. 
To train the model for classification, we will add a column in both the datasets as real or fake. 

Logistic regression is one of the most popular Machine Learning algorithms,
which comes under the Supervised Learning technique.
It is used for predicting the categorical dependent variable using a given set of independent variables.
